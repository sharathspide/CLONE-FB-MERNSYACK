# CLONE-FB-MERNSYACK

I am creating a FB clone for learning the MERN Stack, and in the future once I have learned the MERN stack will update the application and deploy it.

For setting-up code:

- Install Node JS
- Install Express JS
- Settup MongoDB

Commands for running the Front-end Code:

- npm init -y
- npm start

Commands for running the Back-End Code:

- npm init -y
- npm i express
- node server.js
